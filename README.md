# Business Understanding
An NGO seeks to provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yield in the Karamoja region of Uganda.

# Problem Statement
The NGO lacks visibility into the overall state of the region and often needs to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities. Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision making of the NGO

# Objectives
Identify regions with lowest total yield
Identify regions with lowest sorghum yield per HA
Identify regions with lowest maize yield per HA
Correlation between population size and yield
Correlation between crop area and yield

# Success criteria
Understanding the areas that have the lowest yields in order for the NGO to prioritize in terms of resource distribution.
